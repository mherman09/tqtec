~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~
TQTec calculates the one-dimensional transient thermal field for an area that
experiences processes occurring at tectonic plate boundaries. The package
includes tools for estimating thermochronologic observables corresponding
to the temperature history:

    tqtec:     calculate thermal histories for tectonic processes
    readtqtec: post-process tqtec model outputs
    minage:    model mineral ages for temperature histories
    petro:     model petroleum-related observables for temperature histories
    ftage:     deprecated fission track age tool

Example input model files (which include comments describing their format) are
available in the examples/ directory.

Shell scripts showing how to run models and plot model results are available in
the scripts/ directory. These scripts are included with the TQTec executables when
TQTec is built and installed. The plotting scripts require Generic Mapping Tools
(GMT) version 6.5 or higher to use. Directions for GMT installation are at:
https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/install.html.


INSTALLATION & UPDATING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dependencies:
    - GNU Fortran and C compilers
    - CMake
    - Make
Optional Dependencies (for plotting scripts):
    - Generic Mapping Tools

Installation directions:
    git clone https://github.com/mherman09/tqtec tqtec
    cd tqtec
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --install . [--prefix /path/to/tqtec/dir]

The default installation directory for CMake on UNIX platforms (including macOS)
is /usr/local. Specify /path/to/tqtec/dir to choose a different location to
install TQTec. You will have to include that directory in your PATH environment
variable to make TQTec available whenever you open the terminal.

Updating directions (from the build/ directory):
    git pull
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
