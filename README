OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~
TQTec calculates the one-dimensional transient thermal field for an area that
experiences processes occurring at tectonic plate boundaries. The package
includes tools for estimating thermochronologic observables corresponding
to the temperature history:

    tqtec:     calculate thermal histories for tectonic processes
    readtqtec: post-process tqtec model outputs
    minage:    model mineral ages for temperature histories
    petro:     model petroleum-related observables for temperature histories
    ftage:     deprecated fission track age tool

Example input model files (which include comments describing their format) are
available in the examples/ directory.

Shell scripts for plotting model results are available in the scripts/
directory. These require Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) to use. The plotting
scripts have been developed and tested using GMT 6.5. Directions for GMT
installation are at: https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/install.html.


INSTALLATION & UPDATING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dependencies:
    - GNU Fortran and C compilers
    - CMake
    - Make
Optional Dependencies:
    - Generic Mapping Tools

Installation directions:
    git clone https://github.com/mherman09/tqtec tqtec
    cd tqtec
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --install . [--prefix /path/to/tqtec/dir]

The default installation directory for CMake on UNIX platforms (including macOS)
is /usr/local. Specify /path/to/tqtec/dir to choose a different location to
install TQTec. You will have to include that in your PATH environment variable
to make sure TQTec is available in every terminal session.

Updating directions (from the build/ directory):
    git pull
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
