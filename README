TQTec - (T)emperature, Heat Flow (Q), (Tec)tonics


OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~
TQTec calculates the one-dimensional transient thermal field for an area that
experiences processes occurring at tectonic plate boundaries. The package
includes tools for estimating thermochronologic observables corresponding
to the temperature history.
