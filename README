TQTec - (T)emperature, Heat Flow (Q), (Tec)tonics


OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~
TQTec calculates the one-dimensional transient thermal field for an area that
experiences processes occurring at tectonic plate boundaries. The package
includes tools for estimating thermochronologic observables corresponding
to the temperature history.

    - tqtec: calculate thermal histories for various tectonic processes
    - readtqtec: post-process tqtec model output
    - minage: model mineral thermochronologic ages experiencing temperature(-depth) histories
    - ftage: deprecated fission track age tool; now incorporated into minage


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prerequisites:
    - GNU Fortran and C compilers
    - CMake
    - Make

Basic directions:

    git clone https://github.com/mherman09/tqtec tqtec
    cd tqtec
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. 
    cmake --build .
    cmake --install .

The default installation directory for CMake on UNIX platforms (including macOS)
is /usr/local. To manually define an installation directory for TQTec, replace

    cmake --install .

with

    cmake --install . --prefix /path/to/tqtec/dir
